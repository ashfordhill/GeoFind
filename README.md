# GeoFind

This is my very first Android app. It's a game that allows the user to pinpoint their location guesses on Google Maps.
Once the user confirms their guess, they are shown the distance between the actual location and their guess.

# Other notes
This does not utilize any design patterns or anything fancy in mind. EU and CN cities only have 1 option each. US cities are
the top 100 US cities (by population size). All cities are hardcoded in arrays.
